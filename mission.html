		<h2>Both sides &#8211; <span style="font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;">simplified</span>.</h2>


		<div id="mission">
			<p>We believe that the key to having a conversation about the issues that divide us is to <em>actually hear</em> what the other side is saying. </p>

			<p>This is hard to do because of the wall of noise and emotion that often shuts out what the other side is saying.</p>

			<p>yNotes is a powerful tool for cutting through the noise.  It's a set of short, simple, and meaningful sentences that give you access to the best case for the <em>other side</em>.  That allows you to agree or disagree &#8211; or to refine your position &#8211; based on common sense rather than on emotion.</p>

			<p>Some of the statements you'll find here will be familiar.  Some will be new, because debates evolve all the time. And the videos will let you see what happens when the statements have the emotion added back in.</p>

			<h2>
				<strong>Privatization</strong> should be <span class='up'>promoted.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		
		<p><em>Privatization refers either to selling public property (e.g., a park) or to outsourcing services (e.g., schools, prisons, parking meters) to private companies.</em></p>		
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Privatization is good for public budgets.</h4>
				<p>Many towns and states have trouble making ends meet. Broken budgets lead to higher taxes and sometimes bankruptcy. Privatization means cash up front, and fewer expenses down the road.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Private companies are not driven by politics.</h4>
				<p>Private companies care about the bottom line, so they focus on getting things done rather than on political favors, rivalries, and apathy.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Privatization is the American way.</h4>
				<p>Where possible, we should harness the power of private enterprise to solve our problems. Government-run enterprise should be a last resort.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Privatization is good for the consumer.</h4>
				<p>Compare your last DMV experience with visiting the AAA. Private companies work better because they're accountable to their shareholders, and because they specialize in doing one thing well.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Privatization means handing over control of public assets to private interests.</h4>
				<p>When we privatize a public asset, we lose our say in how it's run. Costs can go up and service can go down and there's nothing we can do about it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Communities that privatize public assets end up wishing they hadn't.</h4>
				<p>Sadly, by the time they discover what privatization does, these communities are locked into contracts drafted by highly skilled lawyers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Privatization contracts are much too long.</h4>
				<p>Contracts that last as long as 20 or even 50 years are the norm, so that the private company can avoid competition for as long as possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Monopolies should never be held by private companies.</h4>
				<p>Water systems or parking meters are monopolies. Monopolies invite price-gouging (profiteering). The best way to avoid this risk is to keep monopolies public.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Profit-driven doesn't mean <em>we</em> get the profits.</h4>
				<p>Businesses can be more efficient than government. But the increased efficiency ends up in the pockets of CEOs and shareholders rather than in the taxpayer's pockets.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Cost-cutting isn't necessarily a good thing.</h4>
				<p>Advocates of privatization like to talk about the savings it will bring. But savings usually come at the cost of cutting corners &#8212; like hiring a poorly paid, low-skilled workforce.</p>

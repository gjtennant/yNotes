				Carbon pollution is causing <strong>global warming</strong> and should be regulated <span class='up'>immediately.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>The scientific consensus leaves no room for doubt.</h4>
				<p>Several peer-reviewed articles are published <em>every day</em>with more evidence that carbon pollution is a grave threat to climate stability and therefore to all of us.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>There's a high risk that we're causing a worldwide catastrophe.</h4>
				<p>Would you let your family drink water from a well that 9 out of 10 tests said was poisoned? Would you ridicule scientists who tried to raise the alarm about it?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The issue of global warming is like where smoking was 25 years ago.</h4>
				<p>Just like the tobacco industry used to do, the fossil fuel industry pays "experts" to keep the truth hidden, so profits can roll for just a little while longer.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Even the oil companies are saying global warming is caused by people.</h4>
				<p>If the CEOs of Shell Oil and Exxon-Mobil say it &#8212; not to mention the Pope, the President of the United States, and the national academies of science of every country that has one &#8212; where does that leave you?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Carbon pollution is causing acidification of the oceans.</h4>
				<p>Some carbon pollution falls into the ocean, making it more acidic. This dissolves the calcium shells of plankton, the base of the ocean's entire food chain.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>It's time to have Congressional hearings about the global warming "hoax."</h4>
				<p>Either there's a conspiracy on the part of the world's scientists to destroy our economy, or there's a conspiracy by industry to put civilization at risk for a few extra years of profit.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The catastrophe will hit the world's poor first and hardest.</h4>
				<p>Allowing tens or hundreds of millions of people to die from extreme weather events caused by our carbon pollution will put us among the greatest mass murderers of History.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The Bible tells us to be concerned about global warming.</h4>
				<p>God appointed Mankind to be steward of this world (Genesis 1:28). What more important stewardship decision is there than addressing global warming?</p>
			</li>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Science changes its mind all the time.</h4>
				<p>Is fat good or bad for you? What about carbs or salt? Chances are that the alarm over global warming is another hysteria that will fade with time.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>It's a conspiracy by scientists.</h4>
				<p>Mainstream scientists are a tight-knit community controlling grants and publishing. This is the perfect recipe for reinforcing a false consensus on global warming.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>It's a conspiracy by World Government proponents.</h4>
				<p>Agreeing with the alarmists on global warming means giving more power &#8212; perhaps emergency powers &#8212; to our government, and even to world bodies like the UN.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Some scientists disagree with the consensus.</h4>
				<p>Every scientific breakthrough is achieved by scientists who buck the conventional wisdom. The minority of scientists who are skeptics of the theory of human-caused global warming may well be right.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The people in charge don't seem too concerned about global warming.</h4>
				<p>If an asteroid were hurtling towards Earth, our leaders would be making it a priority. In the case of global warming, we hear lip service but no real urgency.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Science doesn't really understand climage change very well.</h4>
				<p>This means we shouldn't rush to conclusions and certainly not risk damaging our already fragile economy with overreactions to a problem that may turn out to be nothing.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>There will be technological fixes to the problem of global warming.</h4>
				<p>Research is being conducted into solutions like carbon capture and geo-engineering, as well as alternative energy. We just need to let innovation take its course.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The Bible says that we shouldn't hold Nature higher than God.</h4>
				<p>Environmentalism has a tendency to become a form of idolatry, where the "rights" of animals and an inanimate planet are held in higher esteem than God (Romans: 1:25).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The idea that humans have the power to change Earth's climate is ridiculous.</h4>
				<p>The climate is too big, and too complex, and humans are far too small and insignificant.</p>
			</li>

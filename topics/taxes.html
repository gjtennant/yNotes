			<h2>
				<strong>Taxes</strong> should be <span class='up'>cut.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes means throwing money at the problem, encouraging waste and fraud.</h4>
				<p>Our public school system is a perfect example of the false idea that taxing and spending is the solution to our problems. This approach just makes things worse.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes undermine self-reliance.</h4>
				<p>Arbitrary redistribution sends the wrong message to entrepreneurs and the lazy alike. Our system should encourage everyone to work hard, not discourage them.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Redistribution is morally wrong.</h4>
				<p>Taxes are mostly about taking money from those who earn it and giving it to those who don't. Able-bodied people should earn their own money.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>There's too much collectivism.</h4>
				<p>It's gotten way out of control. Taxes should only fund what's absolutely necessary, like national defense, police and fire protection, and the highway system.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>We have perfectly good alternatives to excessive taxation.</h4>
				<p>We have local communities, churches, and charities, and the largesse of the rich &#8211; like when Carnegie built 2,500 public libraries, or the Gates Foundation today.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes are theft.</h4>
				<p>Taxes are when the government takes your money against your will.</p>
			</li>

		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes pay for civilization.</h4>
				<p>The free market can increase our standard of living, but it doesn't give us civilization &#8211; dignity, protection of the vulnerable, a sound infrastructure, air and water quality, etc.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes make everyone pitch in to solve the big problems.</h4>
				<p>Anti-tax folks like to say that private giving can solve problems like poverty. But experience shows that charity never solves the big problems.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Taxes are critical to preventing the return of aristocracy.</h4>
				<p>The Founding Fathers hated the idea of a few families passing down wealth and power from generation to generation.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Cutting taxes means destroying the public systems we've built over the years.</h4>
				<p>This includes our roads; public schools; social security system; protection of our air, water, food supply, and environment; and on and on.</p>

			<h2>We should enforce our <strong>immigration</strong> <span class='up'>laws.</span></h2>
		</a>
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>They're fundamental laws.</h4>
				<p>What more basic law can a nation have than control over its borders?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Ignoring immigration laws is <em>not</em> civil disobedience.</h4>
				<p>Civil rights workers were making a statement of conscience, and willing to go to jail for their beliefs. People who violate our immigration laws are acting out of self-interest.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>We don't actually need more immigrants.</h4>
				<p>We don't need to populate empty lands or to staff our factories. And we've got plenty of diversity at this point.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Uncontrolled immigration is a clear and present danger to our country.</h4>
				<p>Overpopulation is a threat to our environment. Unassimilated populations are a threat to our institutions, including schools and language. Poor immigrants lower wages and burden our social services.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Illegal immigration leads to exploitation of a vulnerable group.</h4>
				<p>Illegal immigration provides a ready source of exploitable labor.Â  The best way to stop this exploitation is to enforce our immigration laws.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>We're all immigrants.</h4>
				<p>The vast majority of Americans are immigrants or descended from immigrants. It seems hypocritical to pull up the ladder now that we're safely aboard. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Most illegal immigrants are Americans in all but name.</h4>
				<p>These are folks who've been here most of their lives, are law-abiding, speak English, go to school, and pay taxes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Immigrants contribute a lot to our society.</h4>
				<p>They're incredibly motivated, hard-working, and resourceful individuals. It's what made us great and what will continue to make us great.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>We invited them here.</h4>
				<p>We ask illegal immigrants to work &#8212; in our fields, restaurants, and homes. It seems hypocritical to invite them in and then threaten them with expulsion.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Immigration laws promote exploitation of a vulnerable group.</h4>
				<p>The best way to prevent this exploitation is to give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Illegal immigrants are a pillar of our economy.</h4>
				<p>Multiply 10 million workers by 2,000 hours per year by $5 per hour (or more) that they're underpaid. That adds up to a $100 <em>billion</em> gift to our economy, far more than what they cost us in services.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>It's inhumane to deport illegal immigrants.</h4>
				<p>They don't have a home anywhere else, it breaks up families, and many of these immigrants would be put into very dangerous situations by being deported to their home countries.</p>

				<strong>Right-to-Work</strong> laws should be <span class='up'>supported.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		
		<p><em>Right-to-work laws allow people to work in a unionized workplace without joining the union or paying dues to that union.</em></p>
		
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Right-to-Work laws protect a worker's right to choose.</h4>
				<p>Why should a worker be forced to support an organization he/she does not like? It's totalitarian to force people to join a union, or to pay dues against their will.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Right-to-Work laws create jobs.</h4>
				<p>Unions hinder economic growth, and Right-to-Work laws undermine union power.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Right-to-Work laws are <em>designed</em> to kill unions.</h4>
				<p>In America, workers have a basic right to stick together. Allowing some workers to get the benefits without paying dues is a simple way to kill unions. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Right-to-Work laws mean union members have to pay for non-union members.</h4>
				<p>With Right-to-Work, a union has to negotiate on behalf of all workers, so even the non-union workers benefit from the union &#8212; without paying any dues.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Right-to-Work leads to lower wages for workers.</h4>
				<p>Workers in Right-to-Work states make about $1,500 less per year than those in non-Right-to-Work states.</p>
			</li>

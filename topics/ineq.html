			<h2>
				We've reached an unacceptable level of <strong>economic <span class='up'>inequality.</span></strong>
			</h2>
		</a>
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Extreme inequality is bad for democracy.</h4>
				<p>Whoever owns the country gets to make the decisions. With extreme inequality only few people own the country. This used to be called an aristocracy.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Extreme inequality is bad for the economy.</h4>
				<p>Middle-class people <em>spend</em> most of their money, which boosts the economy. Very rich people don't (it's hard to spend millions every month), which keeps money out of the economy.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Extreme inequality is the result of a rules changes.</h4>
				<p>Very high inequality has come from recent changes in rules &#8212; like the tax code. This has allowed people who used to be just <em>successful</em> to become <em>obscenely rich</em>.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Freedom leads to inequality.</h4>
				<p>Inequality, even great inequality, is the cost of Freedom. And Freedom is our core American value.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Inequality promotes individual effort.</h4>
				<p>Human nature dictates that we only give our best when we know that there will be winners and losers. Competition is what has made America great.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The alternative to inequality is socialism.</h4>
				<p>Inequality has its dark side, but the alternative is much worse. It's basically government controlling wealth, either by redistributing it or by getting rid of the free market altogether.</p>

				The <strong>minimum wage</strong> should be enough to live <span class='up'>on.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>A poverty wage means taxpayers like you have to pay for the food stamps.</h4>
				<p>Wouldn't it be simpler and more honest to just pay people enough to live on?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Why should I subsidize rich employers like McDonalds or Walmart?</h4>
				<p>Food stamps are a pillar of these employers' business model. They pay too little, knowing that the taxpayers will pay the rest.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>If full-time workers qualify for food stamps, the minimum wage is too low.</h4>
				<p>A poverty wage is when full-time workers need assistance from the government &#8211; like food stamps, Medicaid, and housing benefits &#8211; to make ends meet.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The purpose of the minimum wage is to prevent exploitation.</h4>
				<p>In this sense, minimum wage laws are like workplace safety regulations.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Yes, it's designed to kill jobs &#8211; sweatshop jobs.</h4>
				<p>If your business can only thrive by exploiting workers, then you shouldn't be in business.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Raising the minimum wage will actually boost the economy.</h4>
				<p>Every extra dollar that low-income workers earn is spent. Basic economics tells us that more spending means more jobs, with ripple effects across the economy.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>They don't deserve it.</h4>
				<p>Not every worker is worth the same amount. It's crazy to tell business owners that every retail clerk or burger flipper is worth, say, $15 per hour.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What about the folks who currently earn, say, $15?</h4>
				<p>Raising the minimum wage will be unfair to skilled workers who will be earning no more than unskilled workers.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>It will cause inflation.</h4>
				<p>Raising the minimum wage hurts middle-class people, because it will mean higher prices for things that are already expensive, like food and clothing.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Raising the minimum wage will kill jobs.</h4>
				<p>Small businesses are America's real job creators. And when small business owners are forced to pay higher wages, that forces them to lay off workers or stop hiring.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Let the Market set the wage.</h4>
				<p>Wages go up or down with the economy. Politicians should be working on getting the economy in better shape instead of burdening busineses with higher costs.</p>

				We should work to eliminate <strong>nuclear <span class='up'>weapons.</span></strong>
			</h2>
		</a>
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Nukes are useless against terrorists.</h4>
				<p>Say Al-Qaeda got a hold of a bomb and used it against us. What civilian population would we nuke?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Nukes are not a useful deterrent against fanatics.</h4>
				<p>The idea of deterrence fails completely in the case of a suicide bomber, or a fanatical state. They don't care about the consequences to themselves.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Nukes aren't needed even against nuclear states.</h4>
				<p>Imagine that Iran or North Korea actually used a nuclear weapon. We could easily obliterate Teheran or Pyongyang with conventional carpet-bombing.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Conservative statesmen have recognized that nukes make us <em>less</em> safe.</h4>
				<p>George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, and Ronald Reagan have all argued for the gradual elimination of all nuclear weapons.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Nuclear exchanges can cause nuclear winters.</h4>
				<p>If India and Pakistan had a nuclear exchange, this could cause enough soot to reach the atmosphere to block sunlight and interrupt the food chain for the whole planet.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Our nukes encourage others to get them.</h4>
				<p>Iran wouldn't push for nukes if the US and Israel didn't have them. And if we didn't have them, we could easily make sure they didn't either.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Weak states with nukes are a scary prospect.</h4>
				<p>We'll be sorry we didn't push harder to end the nuclear era if Pakistan ever falls to the Taliban &#8211; or if terrorists steal or buy nukes from Pakistan's army.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Nuclear weapons are designed to kill civilians.</h4>
				<p>They can't be targeted against military installations because their impact zone is too big. Killing civilians with weapons of mass destruction is a crime against humanity.</p>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Nukes preserve peace.</h4>
				<p>We haven't had a world war since the introduction of nuclear weapons. This is because of deterrence &#8211; every country is kept in line by the idea of "mutual assured destruction."</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The cold war might be coming back.</h4>
				<p>Russia and China both have been more aggressive of late. This is a bad time to be thinking about getting rid of our nuclear defense.</p>

				We should be able to regulate <span class='up'><strong>guns</strong>.</span>
			</h2>
		</a>
		
		<h3>Reasons Why</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Guns produce a climate of fear.</h4>
				<p>The flood of unregulated guns mean that cops now have approach drivers at a traffic stop with drawn guns. Why would we want to go back to the Old West?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What's so special about guns?</h4>
				<p>Does the Second Amendment cover the right to bear rocket launchers? Hand-grenades? Flame throwers? Suicide vests? Brass knuckles? Tanks? If we can regulate these, we can regulate guns.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>All rights are subject to regulation.</h4>
				<p>We can't yell "fire!" in a crowded theater or call for the violent overthrow of the government or slander people. Why is the Second Amendment different from the others?</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Each state has different customs and problems.</h4>
				<p>Why should New York City and rural Montana be covered by the same gun laws?  This is exactly what States' Rights are for.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>The Second Amendment has disgusting origins.</h4>
				<p>It was insisted on by the Southern states because of their slave rebellion problem, not to protect us from our own government or from criminals.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Reasons Why Not</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>The Second Amendment is pretty clear.</h4>
				<p>If we don't like it, then we should amend it.  But for now, as the Supreme Court decided, it gives us the right to bear arms.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>I have the right to defend myself and my family from crime.</h4>
				<p>There are lots of guns and bad people out there, and not enough police.  The government doesn't have the right to take away my right to defend myself.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>An armed citizenry discourages dictatorships.</h4>
				<p>Street protests are a way of pushing back against government power.  An armed citizenry is the last line of defense against tyranny.</p>
			</li>
